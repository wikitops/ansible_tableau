# Ansible : Playbook Tableau

The aim of this project is to deploy a Tableau instance on Vagrant instances.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to run this Ansible playbook :

*   [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/installation/) must be installed on your computer
*   Update the Vagrant file based on your computer (CPU, memory), if needed
*   Update the operating system to deploy in the Vagrant file (default: Ubuntu)

### Usage

A good point with Vagrant is that you can create, update and destroy all architecture easily with some commands.

Be aware that you need to be in the Vagrant directory to be able to run the commands.

#### Deployment

To deploy Tableau on Vagrant instance, just run this command :

```bash
$ vagrant up
```

If everything run as expected, you should be able to list the virtual machine created :

```bash
$ vagrant status

Current machine states:

tableau01                   running (virtualbox)
```

If everything run has expected, you should be able to access the Tableau Server Console : http://10.0.1.31/

#### Destroy

To destroy the Vagrant resources created, just run this command :

```bash
$ vagrant destroy
```

### How-To

This section list some simple command to use and manage the playbook and the Vagrant hosts.

#### Update with Ansible

To update the Tableau instance configuration with Ansible, you just have to run the Ansible playbook tableau.yml with this command :

```bash
$ ansible-playbook tableau.yml
```

#### Update with Vagrant

To update the Tableau instance configuration with Vagrant, you just have to run provisioning part of the Vagrant file :

```bash
$ vagrant provision
```

#### Connect to Vagrant instance

To be able to connect to a Vagrant instance, you should use the CLI which is configured to automatically use the default SSH key :

```bash
$ vagrant ssh pip01
```
